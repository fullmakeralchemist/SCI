## What is Raspberry Pi PICO?
Raspberry Pi Pico is a tiny, fast, and versatile board built using RP2040, the flagship microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK.

A Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller device. Microcontrollers are tiny computers, but they tend to lack large volume storage and peripheral devices that you can plug in (for example, keyboards or monitors).

A Raspberry Pi Pico has GPIO pins, much like a Raspberry Pi computer, which means it can be used to control and receive input from a variety of electronic devices.

## What you will need 

Hardware
* A Raspberry Pi Pico with soldered headers
* A computer that can run the Thonny IDE and program a Raspberry Pi Pico
* A micro USB cable
* A selection of electronics components, such as a button, an LED with appropriate resistor, and a potentiometer (optional)
* A breadboard and M-M jumper leads for connecting additional components (optional)
* An external 5V micro USB power source (optional)

Software
The project will guide you through the installation of:

* MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico [MicroPython UF2 file for your board](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/rp2-pico-latest.uf2)
* The Thonny Python IDE

## Configurate

Press the BOOTSEL button and hold it while you connect the other end of the micro USB cable to your computer. A Raspberry Pi is shown in the image below, but the same applies to any computer.

Click on the Python version and choose ‚ÄòMicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)‚Äô:

If you don‚Äôt see this option, then check that you have plugged in your Raspberry Pi Pico.
