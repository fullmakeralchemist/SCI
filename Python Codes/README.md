## What is Python?
Python is an object-oriented (based around data), high-level (easier for humans to understand) programming language. First launched in 1992, it‚Äôs built in a way that it‚Äôs relatively intuitive to write and understand. As such, it‚Äôs an ideal coding language for those who want rapid development. 

## Why is Python so popular? 
According to the TIOBE index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, Python is the third most popular programming language in the world, behind only Java and C. There are many reasons for the ubiquity of Python, including: 

* Its ease of use. For those who are new to coding and programming, Python can be an excellent first step. It‚Äôs relatively easy to learn, making it a great way to start building your programming knowledge.
* Its simple syntax. Python is relatively easy to read and understand, as its syntax is more like English. Its straightforward layout means that you can work out what each line of code is doing. 
* Its thriving community. As it‚Äôs an open-source language, anyone can use Python to code. What‚Äôs more, there is a community that supports and develops the ecosystem, adding their own contributions and libraries. 
* Its versatility. As we‚Äôll explore in more detail, there are many uses for Python. Whether you‚Äôre interested in data visualisation, artificial intelligence or web development, you can find a use for the language. 

## Where can I learn Python?

There is a lot of places to learn Python like, Many short and advanced courses, such as:
* [Getting Started with Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/programming-for-everybody-python)
* [Deep learning and Python programming](https://www.futurelearn.com/experttracks/advanced-ai-microsoft-azure)
* [Coursera](https://es.coursera.org/)
* [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) (Type and look for the Python course, look for the one with more views)
* [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)


## What is Python used for?
Clearly, Python is a popular and in-demand skill to learn. But what is python programming used for? We‚Äôve already briefly touched on some of the areas it can be applied to, and we‚Äôve expanded on these and more Python examples below. Python can be used for:  

1. AI and machine learning 
Because Python is such a stable, flexible, and simple programming language, it‚Äôs perfect for various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. In fact, Python is among the favourite languages among data scientists, and there are many Python machine learning and AI libraries and packages available. 

2. Data analytics 
Much like AI and machine learning, data analytics is another rapidly developing field that utilises Python programming. At a time when we‚Äôre creating more data than ever before, there is a need for those who can collect, manipulate and organise the information. Python for data science and analytics makes sense. The language is easy-to-learn, flexible, and well-supported, meaning it‚Äôs relatively quick and easy to use for analysing data. When working with large amounts of information, it‚Äôs useful for manipulating data and carrying out repetitive tasks.  

3. Data visualisation 
Data visualisation is another popular and developing area of interest. Again, it plays into many of the strengths of Python. As well as its flexibility and the fact it‚Äôs open-source, Python provides a variety of graphing libraries with all kinds of features. Whether you‚Äôre looking to create a simple graphical representation or a more interactive plot, you can find a library to match your needs. Examples include Pandas Visualization and Plotly. The possibilities are vast, allowing you to transform data into meaningful insights. 

4. Programming applications 
You can program all kinds of applications using Python. The general-purpose language can be used to read and create file directories, create GUIs and APIs, and more. Whether it‚Äôs blockchain applications, audio and video apps, or machine learning applications, you can build them all with Python. 

5. Web development 
Python is a great choice for web development. This is largely due to the fact that there are many Python web development frameworks to choose from, such as Django, Pyramid, and Flask. These frameworks have been used to create sites and services such as Spotify, Reddit and Mozilla. Thanks to the extensive libraries and modules that come with Python frameworks, functions such as database access, content management, and data authorisation are all possible and easily accessible. Given its versatility, it‚Äôs hardly surprising that Python is so widely used in web development. 

6. Game development 
Although far from an industry-standard in game development, Python does have its uses in the industry. It‚Äôs possible to create simple games using the programming language, which means it can be a useful tool for quickly developing a prototype. Similarly, certain functions (such as dialogue tree creation) are possible in Python. If you‚Äôre new to either Python or game development, then you can also discover how to make a text-based game in Python. In doing so, you can work on a variety of skills and improve your knowledge in various areas.
